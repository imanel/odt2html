<p lang="en-GB" class="western">A consortium of companies and
organizations have banded together to form the <a href="http://www.odfalliance.org/news.asp">"ODF
Alliance,"</a> a group dedicated to promoting the office
software file format first implemented by OpenOffice.org. The
alliance consists of more than 35 members from various countries
around the world. It includes companies such as Red Hat, IBM, Novell,
Sun Microsystems, and Corel, and governmental organizations such as
the American Library Association and the Information and
Communications Technology council for the city of Vienna.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The<b> OpenDocument</b> file format
was formed by the industry consortium OASIS, a group headed by Sun
Microsystems, and was based on OpenOffice.org's native file format.
OpenOffice.org is itself an open-sourced version of Star Office, the
proprietary office suite that Sun purchased when it acquired the
German company Star Division in 1999. The idea behind OpenDocument
was to use a text-based XML format (compressed in a zip file to
conserve disk space) in order to make it easy for other products to
interoperate with it. The specification was finalized in 2005 and
OpenOffice.org was the first software suite to support it. Other
projects, such as KOffice, AbiWord, and IBM Workplace are adding
support for the ODF format, either natively or through plug-in format
translators.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">In today's highly networked world, it
turns out that operability is a very useful thing to have, which is
why Microsoft decided that they would also jump on the XML bandwagon,
introducing a new XML-based file format (.docx) for Office 2003. Not
only that, but the company is planning to make the next version of
the Office XML format the default for Office 2007 (formerly known as
Office 12). This means that when users of Office 2007 go to save a
file, they will automatically save in .docx, not .doc.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">While most people don't consider file
formats to be terribly exciting, the question of which format to
adopt led to an increasingly dramatic series of announcements from
the government of Massachusetts. In January 2005, the government
<a href="http://www.crn.com/sections/breakingnews/breakingnews.jhtml;jsessionid=GCCZBBT3QQVBGQSNDBOCKHSCJUMEKJVN?articleId=57701551">approved</a>
Office XML 2003 as an appropriate file format, then in September of
that year <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050906-5279.html">reversed</a>
their decision, stating that Office XML was unacceptable and that
only OpenDocument and PDF files would be allowed. They went <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051128-5637.html">back
again</a> in November, stating that they were "very pleased"
with Microsoft's submission of Office XML to the ECMA standards body,
and that they were "optimistic that Office Open XML will meet
our new standards for acceptable open formats." The champion of
ODF in Massachusetts, CIO Peter Quinn, then suddenly announced his
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060104-5895.html">resignation</a>
in January. This announcement was followed with an assurance from
Quinn's former boss that their position on ODF "remained
unchanged" and that they were still committed to supporting that
format.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Confused yet? The so-called
"controversy" over the ODF switch has generated an
unbelievable amount of press, and various groups are now busy pushing
governments worldwide to switch over to the ODF format. This new
"alliance" joins the groups SpreadOpenDocument.org, the
OpenDocument Fellowship, and the "Friends of OpenDocument"
in their quest to promote the format. My own inbox is now slowly
filling up with pro-ODF announcements and press releases. The push
seems overtly political, as evidenced by the rhetoric used by the ODF
Alliance:
