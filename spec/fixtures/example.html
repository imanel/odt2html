      &quot;ODF Alliance&quot; formed to support OpenDocument format

      A consortium of companies and organizations have banded together to form
      the 
      <a href='http://www.odfalliance.org/news.asp'>
        &quot;ODF Alliance,&quot;
      </a>
       a group dedicated to promoting the office software file format first
      implemented by OpenOffice.org. The alliance consists of more than 35
      members from various countries around the world. It includes companies
      such as Red Hat, IBM, Novell, Sun Microsystems, and Corel, and
      governmental organizations such as the American Library Association and
      the Information and Communications Technology council for the city of
      Vienna.

      The
      <span class='T1'>
         OpenDocument
      </span>
       file format was formed by the industry consortium OASIS, a group headed
      by Sun Microsystems, and was based on OpenOffice.org&apos;s native file
      format. OpenOffice.org is itself an open-sourced version of Star Office,
      the proprietary office suite that Sun purchased when it acquired the
      German company Star Division in 1999. The idea behind OpenDocument was to
      use a text-based XML format (compressed in a zip file to conserve disk
      space) in order to make it easy for other products to interoperate with
      it. The specification was finalized in 2005 and OpenOffice.org was the
      first software suite to support it. Other projects, such as KOffice,
      AbiWord, and IBM Workplace are adding support for the ODF format, either
      natively or through plug-in format translators.

      In today&apos;s highly networked world, it turns out that operability is a
      very useful thing to have, which is why Microsoft decided that they would
      also jump on the XML bandwagon, introducing a new XML-based file format
      (.docx) for Office 2003. Not only that, but the company is planning to
      make the next version of the Office XML format the default for Office 2007
      (formerly known as Office 12). This means that when users of Office 2007
      go to save a file, they will automatically save in .docx, not .doc.

      While most people don&apos;t consider file formats to be terribly
      exciting, the question of which format to adopt led to an increasingly
      dramatic series of announcements from the government of Massachusetts. In
      January 2005, the government 
      <a href='http://www.crn.com/sections/breakingnews/breakingnews.jhtml;jsessionid=GCCZBBT3QQVBGQSNDBOCKHSCJUMEKJVN?articleId=57701551'>
        approved
      </a>
       Office XML 2003 as an appropriate file format, then in September of that
      year 
      <a href='http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050906-5279.html'>
        reversed
      </a>
       their decision, stating that Office XML was unacceptable and that only
      OpenDocument and PDF files would be allowed. They went 
      <a href='http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051128-5637.html'>
        back again
      </a>
       in November, stating that they were &quot;very pleased&quot; with
      Microsoft&apos;s submission of Office XML to the ECMA standards body, and
      that they were &quot;optimistic that Office Open XML will meet our new
      standards for acceptable open formats.&quot; The champion of ODF in
      Massachusetts, CIO Peter Quinn, then suddenly announced his 
      <a href='http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060104-5895.html'>
        resignation
      </a>
       in January. This announcement was followed with an assurance from
      Quinn&apos;s former boss that their position on ODF &quot;remained
      unchanged&quot; and that they were still committed to supporting that
      format.

    <p class='Text_20_body'>
      Confused yet? The so-called &quot;controversy&quot; over the ODF switch
      has generated an unbelievable amount of press, and various groups are now
      busy pushing governments worldwide to switch over to the ODF format. This
      new &quot;alliance&quot; joins the groups SpreadOpenDocument.org, the
      OpenDocument Fellowship, and the &quot;Friends of OpenDocument&quot; in
      their quest to promote the format. My own inbox is now slowly filling up
      with pro-ODF announcements and press releases. The push seems overtly
      political, as evidenced by the rhetoric used by the ODF Alliance:
